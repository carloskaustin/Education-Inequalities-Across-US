# 📚 Education Inequality in U.S. States
## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes nationwide school data using Python to uncover patterns of inequality across different states. The analysis highlights disparities in funding, test scores, student–teacher ratios, dropout rates, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

By applying multivariable scatter plots and a correlation heatmap, the project identifies key trends and underserved school zones, offering a data-driven perspective on educational challenges.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: Education Inequality Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shamimhasan8/education-inequality-data/code)

- Variables include:

- Funding per student

- Average test scores

- Student–teacher ratio

- Dropout rate

- Percentage of low-income students

- Percentage of minority students

- Internet access availability

## 🛠️ Methods

## Tools & Libraries:

- Python (Pandas, NumPy) → Data cleaning & analysis

- Seaborn & Matplotlib → Data visualization

## Steps Taken:

- Cleaned and pre-processed raw Kaggle dataset.

- Created a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between key variables.

- Built multivariable scatter plots to visualize how states compare on funding, test scores, dropout rates, and demographics.

- Summarized state-level insights.

## 🔑 Key Insights

- Michigan: Second-lowest test scores and near the bottom in funding.

- Texas & Illinois: Highest dropout rates, both in the lower half of funding.

- Student–Teacher Ratios: All states except Michigan exceed 19 students per teacher.

- Georgia: Highest percentage of low-income students (56%+).

## 🚀 Next Steps

Future directions for this project could include:

- State-by-State Deep Dive → Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of all 10 states individually.

- Breakdown by Grade Level & School Type → Explore how inequalities differ across elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as between public, private, and charter schools.

- Predictive Modeling → Build regression or classification models to predict dropout risk or performance gaps.
